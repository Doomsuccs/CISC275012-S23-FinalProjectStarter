I'm a father of three boys who love to play sports. We play and watch basketball, football, and baseball. Whether it comes to buying a new baseball bat, or a new basketball, or new basketball shoes, football, football cleats, you name it! We're always shopping! Lately, we've been using Amazon and Dick's sporting goods but man their customer service and website have been super slow! I'm also not feeling the looks of their website! Those are the things that hold me back from liking those websites! So all I'm hoping for in a good website is one that is stylish, sleek, and quick and efficient! You guys got this!
